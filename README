Appendix C - Operation Counts for the BLAS and LAPACK

www.netlib.org/lapack/lawnspdf/lawn41.pdf

This appendix lists the FLOPs required to compute routines in BLAS and LAPACK
as a function of the size of the input matrices. 

This file doesn't OCR well so I wrote the formulae in by hand. 

Verification:
The document contains formulae for the number of adds, the numbers of multiplies, and the number of total flops. The first two expressions should add to the third. The file test.py reads in this data and checks this assertion on all functions. This method was used to check the accuracy of my transcription.

This process also uncovered some mistakes in the original document, in particular I believe that the functions SGEQRF, SGERQF, and SSYTRD are in error.

test.py depends on Python and the symbolic algebra library SymPy.
